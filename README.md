# Cardano-multissig-address

We need web UI for people to spend from an multisignature address, way to coordinate signatures and submit the transaction.

## Build a tx
## Sign
## Collect signatures & submit
It should be possible to do without using a server, by allowing downloading/uploading of tx and signature files. 
However users needs both options.
